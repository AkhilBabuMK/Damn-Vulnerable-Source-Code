# Damn-Vulnerable-Source-Code

Description :

An application written in python and flask security enthusiasts to sharpen their skills in source code review. There are a lots of time when as security researchers we may need to analyse source code without a working application front end to understand the functionalities. This open source project aims to provide a platform for beginners to start reviewing source code manually without the UI.

The aim of the project is to develop intentionally vulnerable source code in various languages.

At present we are trying to build common vulnerabilities based on OWASP Top 10.

Contributors are always welcome to the project. We require more people to be a part of the same.

The code will be posted on the GitHub repo coming days and an application structure and a vulnerability list will be present.

Those who are interested you can make application in whichever language you are comfortable with including the vulnerabilities listed and maintaining the structure of the application and create a submission to the GitHub.

Keep an eye on this repo for the updates.
